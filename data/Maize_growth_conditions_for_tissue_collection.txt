Maize growth conditions for tissue collection

Endosperm:

Ears were sib pollinated and collected 15 DAP and transported to the lab. Endosperm was dissected, frozen in LN2 in 15 ml Falcon tubes, and stored in -80C till used.
	
Pollen:

Shedding tassels were bagged in the evening and mature pollen was collected the next day. After passing through a sieve to remove anthers, pollen was frozen in LN2 in 15 ml Falcon tubes, and stored in -80C till used.

Ears:

Plants that seemed to be at the right stage of growth were collected from the field, brought to the lab, and primary and secondary ears were dissected. 5-10 mm ears were frozen in LN2 in 15 ml Falcon tubes, and stored in -80C till used.

Root tips:

Seeds were germinated on wet paper towels in a Pyrex dish kept in the incubator at 26°C in continuous darkness. After 5 days, 1-3 mm root tips were cut off with a razor blade on ice, frozen LN2 in microfuge tubes, and stored in -80C till used.

Coleoptilar Nodes:

Seeds were germinated in flats in a growth chamber set to long day (lights 7am to 11pm), 27C day and 24C night, and light at 130 micromoles at the top flat. After 5 days seedlings were unearthed and 5 mm sections around coleoptilar nodes were dissected on ice, frozen in LN2 in microfuge tubes, and stored in -80C till used.
